## About me
I am 25 years old and I've been a front-end developer since 2019, I'm good at adaptive layout, html, CSS and js. I'm actively learning and practicing react and typescript respectively. Before starting my frontend career I had been an English teacher for over 5 years (abroad as well), so it's not a problem for me to communicate in English.
I understand that I can achive and learn much more, so I'm searching for a job where I can do my best. I'm quite a fast learner If I have practice. If I don't understand something I try to google it first then I ask for help. I don't give up and try to do everything well. I'm good at team work, I've worked together with Backend developers, designers and SEO specialists.
